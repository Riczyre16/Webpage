            One of my top pastimes is watching anime, especially "One Piece." It follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man with a simple dream: finding the legendary treasure, One Piece, and becoming the King of the Pirates.<sup>1</sup> With his loyal crew, Luffy sails the perilous seas of the Grand Line in search of Laugh Tale, the mysterious island said to hold the coveted treasure.<sup>2</sup>
        </p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>
            Apart from anime, I also enjoy diving into various video games, like RPGs and scenario-based ones.<sup>3</sup> Lately, I've been hooked on "Middle-earth: Shadow of War." It's set in J.R.R. Tolkien's vast Middle-earth and follows Talion, a ranger seeking revenge against Sauron's forces.<sup>4</sup> After losing his family to Sauron's minions, Talion is brought back to life by the wraith of Celebrimbor, an Elven Lord, who grants him spectral abilities to aid in his quest for vengeance.<sup>5</sup>
        </p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>
            "Shadow of War" lets players explore expansive landscapes, overcome obstacles with nimble movements, and even ride formidable beasts across the terrain.<sup>6</sup> Forge Towers serve as handy waypoints for swift travel, streamlining navigation through the game world.<sup>7</sup> Despite facing numerous hurdles and enemies, Talion's determination and newfound powers drive him forward in his mission to confront the darkness threatening Middle-earth.<sup>8</sup>
        </p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>
            Whether I'm joining Luffy and his crew on their epic journeys or battling evil forces as Talion, these hobbies provide me with endless entertainment and thrills.<sup>9</sup> They offer a welcome escape from reality, immersing me in exciting narratives and engaging gameplay experiences.<sup>10</sup>
